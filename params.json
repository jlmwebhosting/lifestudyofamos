The Cause of Jehovah's Visitation\r\nVerses 3 through 8 indicate that the cause of Jehovah's visitation (punishment) was that Israel was not one with God. They had their own intention, goal, and purpose, and God had His. But God revealed all His secrets to His prophets. Israel, therefore, should have listened to the prophets.\r\n\r\nVerse 7 says, \"They turn justice to wormwood/And thrust righteousness down to the ground.\" This means that the leaders did not care for justice and righteousness and did not care for the people according to the law of God. Instead, they turned justice into something bitter and cast righteousness to the ground.\r\nVerses 8 and 9 continue, \"He who makes the Pleiades and Orion/And turns the shadow of death into the morning/And darkens the day with the night;/He who calls for the water of the sea/And pours it upon the surface of the earth,/Jehovah is His name,/Who causes destruction to flash forth upon the strong,/So that destruction comes upon the fortress.\" Since God can do these things, Israel should be advised to seek Him and live.\r\n\r\n4. Israel's Transgressions of Injustice\r\nin Spite of Their Hypocritical Services\r\nwith Offerings to Jehovah, and Jehovah's Visitation\r\nVerses 10 through 27 describe Israel's transgressions of injustice in spite of their hypocritical services with offerings to Jehovah, and Jehovah's visitation. They hated him who reproved in the gate, the place where the leading ones exercised judgment, and they abhorred the one who spoke with integrity (v. 10). They took a forced gift (a bribe) from the poor (v. 11). Their transgressions were many, and their sins were mighty (awful). Eventually, the day of Jehovah will come upon them, a horrible day, and they will suffer woe, for it will be darkness to them and not light (vv. 16-20).\r\nOn the one hand, the people of Israel were evil; on the other hand, they still worshipped God with offerings. They liked to have the feasts and to assemble for the worship of God. Because of their hypocrisy, Jehovah said to them, \"I hate, I despise your feasts,/And I will not delight in your solemn assemblies\" (v. 21). He went on to tell them to take away from Him the noise of their songs and \"let justice roll down like water,/And righteousness, like an ever-flowing river\" (vv. 23-24). Instead of making noise and singing songs, they should exercise justice and practice righteousness.\r\nAll the Prophets are on the same subject, but each one gives a different picture from a different angle or with a different aspect. By reading all the Prophets we can realize how evil the children of Israel were and how loving God was toward them.\r\nBeginning approximately two hundred years before the coming of Nebuchadnezzar, God sent the prophets to warn Israel, to advise them, and to call them to return to God. However, Israel did not listen to the prophets. This forced God to send the four kinds of locusts (Joel 1:4) to chastise Israel for twenty-seven centuries. From this we all need to learn an important lesson: God means business. For twenty-seven centuries God has been sending locusts to deal with Israel. Today the Roman Empire is still consuming Israel, and Israel continues to suffer.\r\nIn the midst of such a situation, God has done something marvelous. First, He came to be incarnated as a man, and He lived on earth to set up a model of how to have the divine life expressed in humanity, of how to have the divine attributes expressed in the human virtues. Then He died a particular death for our sins, and He entered into resurrection and ascended. Then He was poured out as the Spirit in His descension to be one with us to produce a corporate Christ, that is, the Body of Christ.\r\nAll these things are mysterious. No one can see them. But these are the things that accomplished God's economy. The chastising of Israel and the judgment on the nations are the \"shell\"; they are not the \"kernel.\" The kernel is the mysterious things in the age of mystery, which began with Christ's incarnation and will end with Christ's second appearing. These are the governing principles that we should hold when we read the Old Testament, especially the Prophets.\r\nToday three things are taking place on earth: the chastisement of God over Israel, God's punishment of the nations, and the manifestation of Christ. Today we are enjoying all the conveniences invented by the Roman Empire for the manifestation of Christ. The chastisement of Israel, the punishment of the nations, and the manifestation of Christ are great matters, for they are the items of the universal history according to God's economy.\r\n\r\n1. Israel, Especially the High Class,\r\nLiving at Ease a Life of Luxuries\r\nIn this introduction Israel, especially the high class, is described as living at ease a life of luxuries and pleasures but turning justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood, rejoicing in things of vanity, and boasting of taking horns for themselves by their own strength (vv. 1-6, 12-13). They boasted that they enjoyed everything and had everything by their own strength and through their own capability.\r\n\r\nThat the Lord Jehovah Would Forgive\r\nBecause Jacob Was Small and Could Not Stand\r\nWhen the prophet saw that the eating of the herbage of the land was complete, he prayed, \"O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech You! How will Jacob stand, for he is small?\" (v. 2). Some of the punishments ordained of God have not taken place because some of God's loving ones, the prophets, prayed for Israel, warning God that Israel might not endure.\r\n2. Jehovah Repenting and Stopping the Plague\r\nWhen Jehovah heard Amos's prayer, He repented and stopped the plague (v. 3).\r\n\r\n1. The Lord Telling Amos\r\nThat He Was Now Setting a Plumb Line\r\nin the Midst of His People Israel\r\nThe Lord was holding a plumb line to measure Israel in order to determine what part had to be destroyed and what part had to be retained. Here the Lord was like a surgeon, knowing what should be cut off and what should remain.\r\nThe Lord told Amos that He was now setting a plumb line in the midst of His people Israel (v. 8a). He said, \"The high places of Isaac will be desolated,/And the sanctuaries of Israel will be made waste;/And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword\" (v. 9). The \"high places\" were the places where Israel worshipped the idols on the mountains. The expression \"sanctuaries of Israel\" refers not to the sanctuary in the city of Jerusalem but mainly to the sanctuaries in Bethel, in the northern kingdom of Israel. God would make them waste; He would attack the house of Jeroboam (one of the kings of Israel) with a sword.\r\n\r\n3. The Lacking of the Word of Jehovah\r\nVerses 11 through 13 indicate that there will be the lacking of the word of Jehovah. Our lacking of the word of Jehovah is a kind of punishment from Jehovah. For example, after Abraham took Hagar to produce Ishmael, God did not speak to him for thirteen years (Gen. 16:15â€”17:1). In the northern kingdom of Israel, the same thing happened. Because of their sins against the Lord, He would not speak to them.\r\n\r\n3. The Lord's Destruction of Israel\r\nNot an Utter Destruction of the House of Jacob\r\nVerses 7 through 10 reveal that the Lord's destruction of Israel the sinful kingdom would not be an utter destruction of the house of Jacob. The Lord would cause them to suffer but would not allow them to be utterly consumed because He has a purpose. If there had been no Israel left on earth, how could Christ have been born of them? For the purpose of incarnation God had to preserve a remnant of Israel.\r\n\r\n\"In that day I will raise up/The fallen tabernacle of David, /And I will wall up its breaches/And raise up its ruins/And build it up as it was in the days of old;/That they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations which are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this\" (vv. 11-12). This portion of Amos is quoted by James in Acts 15, when the apostles and the elders were gathered together to solve the problem of circumcision.\r\nThe tabernacle of David is the kingdom and the royal family of David. In ancient times it was hard to separate the royal family from the kingdom. Actually these two things are one. David's kingdom was David's royal family. That kingdom, that royal family, fell when Nebuchadnezzar came to capture the nation of Israel, devastate the land, burn the city, destroy the temple, and carry off the king. That was the fall of the kingdom of David and the royal family of David. However, in Amos God came in to promise that some day He would come back to restore the fallen kingdom of David. In that day the kingdom of David and the family of David will be restored, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah.\r\nThis prophecy in Amos indicates that one day Christ will come back to be the real David. When Christ comes back, in His last appearing He will be the real David to restore His kingdom and His royal family. That will be the millennial kingdom, in which all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah, that is, all the nations will belong to God. It was based on this that in Acts 15 James told the Jewish believers not to be bothered by Peter's and Paul's going to the Gentiles, because in the restoration all the Gentiles will belong to God, just like the Jews.\r\nChrist will come and restore the fallen kingdom of David to set up His kingdom for the restoration of the entire universe. At that time all the nations will become God's people. This is a great item in Amos's prophecy.\r\n\r\nE. Standing at the Crossroads\r\nto Cut Off Those of Israel Who Escaped\r\nEdom stood at the crossroads to cut off those of Israel who escaped and delivered them to their enemy in their distress (v. 14).\r\nThere seemed to be nothing but jealousy and hatred between these twin brothers. Esau's hatred of Jacob was not without cause. Jacob not only grasped Esau's heel at their birth (Gen. 25:26) but also cheated Esau of the blessing of the birthright (Gen. 27:18-36). Thus, Esau liked to see Jacob suffer. Whenever Israel suffered from a natural calamity, Edom would rob Israel of their wealth. God's dealing with this situation reveals that He is very human. He judged the nation of Edom concerning a matter of human affection.\r\n\r\nD. Saviors Coming Up on Mount Zion\r\nto Judge the Mountain of Esau\r\nSaviors will come up on Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom will be Jehovah's (v. 21).\r\nE. Fulfilled at the Maccabees' Time\r\nand to Be Much More Fulfilled in Glory\r\nat the Time of Restoration for the Kingdom of God\r\nAll of the aforementioned items of the issue of Jehovah's dealing were fulfilled at the Maccabees' time, and they will be much more fulfilled in glory at the time of restoration for the kingdom of God (Matt. 19:28; Rev. 11:15). The Maccabees, taking Mount Zion as their ground to judge Edom, gained a victory over Antiochus Epiphanes about 165 B.C. The victory of the Maccabees was a type of the victory Israel will gain immediately before the age of restoration.\r\nThe Minor Prophets, including Obadiah, reveal that the nations used by God to chastise sinful Israel do something in excess. Therefore, God will come in to judge the nations. This judgment will issue in Israel's gaining the victory and enlarging their territory for the kingdom of God on earth, especially for God's kingdom in the time of restoration.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
